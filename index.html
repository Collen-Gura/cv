        <!--Lesson: Anchor tags - Hyperlinks (Internet link). The link is URL-->
        <p><em><strong>Founder and Executive Chairman of</strong> <a href="CAG Holdings">CAG Holdings (Pvt) Ltd</a></em></p>
        <p>My name is Collen Gura, a qualified Chartered Accountant, a farmer and an aspiring Robotics Systems Engineer.  I am based in the farming Community of Chakari, Zimbabwe.</p> <p>

        </p>I love farming, finance and software development. My passion for robotics is rekindled by projects and activities of ROS Agriculture and industry giants such as John Deere, Sabanto, among others.</P> <p>

        </p>From a business perspective, it is the essence of pushing the objective of producing food for more people, with less people and less land, using autonomous technology. Through robotics projects, I seek to be more skilled and more involved in computer vision, robotics and artificial intelligence.</p>

      </p>After 34 years of gainful employment in functional roles in accounting, general management, finance, executive management (chief executive officer and board chairman) in the corporate world, I retired from full-time employment in July, 2011, to concentrate  on my family businesses and pursue interests in software enginering and computer science, with emphasis on robotics and farm vehicle automation. In this profile, I intend to focus on my journey in software engineering and computer science. Curious about my corporate life and experience? <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/collen-gura-30140a148/?originalSubdomain=zw" <em> Read on.</em></a></p>

        <p>I love learning and continued learning of new technologies, particulary as it affects agriculture, engineering and mining sectors of the economy. I am not particular about University grades or certificates, but hope that they help boost my confidence and underpin my passion. I am gaining more experience as I lead software development projects in my business and prefer to work mainly in Java, Python, JavaScript and Node.js. Of late, through C++ based projects, C++ has grabbed my attenition and keeps me glued to the screen and my debugging tools.</p>
