        <strong>Project 1:</strong> "Design and Build a Responsive Website"
        <h4>Description:</h4>
          <p>A brief is to design and build a responsive website of a magazine or a newsletter. This may take the form of a topical or a news magazine or a newsletter for a club or society. As much as possible this should represent a real situation. The web site should have 5 pages with different types of news and articles. Wherever possible sample content should be representative of the material for that web site. It should have appropriate media, including video and sound clips, if relevant.</p>

        <strong>Project 3:</strong> Theme Park Site
          <h4>Description:</h4>
            <p>The brief was to produce a Theme Park Website, including design and production of a set of wireframes for the site showing the concepts of both a wide screen and small screen. Decision had to be made on the structure that would have 3 pages, such as, what information will appear on the main page, and what will appear on the other two pages, decision about how to present the content, and whether to have semantic parts such as asides or pop-up windows. The designed three pages were  as follows: First page, Theme Park designer name icon,  access to the Park, prices, intorduction of the Park, clear message as to who the target customers were (mostly families with kids), best rides/attractions, events and opening hours. The second page titled 'Rides and Events' included rides and events separated into sub-categories, and the third page entitled 'Amenities' included everything about hotels, food, medical aid, etc. All pages carried the same design Navbar and background color.</p>

          <strong>Project 4:</strong> Sudoku Puzzle
          <h4>Description:</h4>
            <p>The goal of this project was to produce an algorithm that can generate Sudoku puzzles. The algorithm starts with a vector of four  elements, with all integers 1 to 4 in particular order, e.g 1, 2, 3, 4 or 4, 1, 3, 2. In addition to this vector, the algorithms started with an integer n, being the number of blank spaces in the genral puzzle. The whole process was modular and the big picture was to construct a solved Sudoku puzzle. From the solved puzzle, the algorithm was to remove numbers and replace them with blank entries. The main steps in the puzzle wasto 1) Get the input vector called row and number n, 2) Create a vector of four elements called puzzle, where each element of puzzle is itself the vector row, 3) Cyclically permute the vectors in each element of puzzle so that puzzle satisfies the Sudoku conditions and, 4) Remove values in elements of puzzles to leave blank spaces, and complete the puzzle.</p>
